      <p>Alec Watson posts under his Technology connections account, making technical explanations of consumer electronic products. He goes painstakingly in depth about what makes these products work and explains the physics behind their construction. He Discusses everything from RCAs Vinyl video disc format to 70 year old sunbeam toasters. I love his content because he has a passion for good design while not explicitly saying so. You clearly see his frustration and joy with these products all while he goes in depth about the science behind them.</p>

            <p>I saw Abel Manalos' work at the <a href="https://111minnagallery.com/">111 Minna street gallery</a> in the Skate exhibit, up until June 20th. He makes  stunning woven painted tapestries. I spoke with him at the opening and he has a complete feel for the medium and his process uses no layout or jigs to assist the process of painting or weaving.</p>

      <p>Joel G is a digital animation and 3d artist that makes short film webseries and most recently, videogames. His animations are contrived stories and meaning rendered with painstaking detail and love. Most all of his works but especially his most recent have been community efforts with other very talented people behind it.</p>
